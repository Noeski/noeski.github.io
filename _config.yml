  Hi ðŸ‘‹ my name is Noah and I've been an iOS developer for the past 9 years. I have a wide range of experience in every facet of app development, building from the ground up or refactoring ancient codebases. I am a strong believer in pragmatic programming and bringing the user experience to the forefront.
  
  
  My journey began with `C++` â†’ `Objective-C` â†’ `Swift`

  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
