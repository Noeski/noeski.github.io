  Hi üëã, my name is Noah, and I've been a software developer for the past twelve years. I have a wide range of experience in every facet of iOS development, building from the ground up or refactoring ancient codebases. I am also well-versed in game development, game engine architecture and `Unity`. I am a strong believer in pragmatic programming and bringing the user experience to the forefront.

  Most of my expertise comes from building things in `C#`, `Swift`, `Objective-C` and `C++`, but I always love exploring new languages and better ways of solving problems.
