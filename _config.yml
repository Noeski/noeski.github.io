  Hi üëã, my name is Noah, and I've been an iOS developer for the past nine years. I have a wide range of experience in every facet of app development, building from the ground up or refactoring ancient codebases. I am a strong believer in pragmatic programming and bringing the user experience to the forefront.

  My progression of programming languages is `C++` ‚Üí `Objective-C` ‚Üí `Swift`.
