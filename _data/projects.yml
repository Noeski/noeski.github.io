    Melly is an app that combines a beautiful zen garden with a focus/meditation timer. The more time you spend focusing/meditating the more rewards you will be given to enhance your garden. The hope is that by rewarding you for taking a constructive action that you are able to build healthy habits that can positively impact your life.
    
    I conceptualized and created Melly as a way to limit the daily noise and to make meditation fun and fulfilling.
