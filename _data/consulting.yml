    Beankind is an idle game with a twist - build up 'taps' to unlock new decorations for your room, each 'tap' you contribute is shared to the world which helps unlock global characters for everyone.
        
    I worked with [Ketnipz](https://www.ketnipz.com) and the founder of Frosty Pop to build the Beankind app as well as the backend to support validating and synchronizing each player's 'taps',

    Big Time Sports harkens back to the days of fast arcade action. With over 10 different mini-games to play there’s something for everyone. Big Time Sports is one of Apple Arcade’s exclusive launch titles available on iOS, tvOS, and Mac.
    
    I led the development of Big Time Sports, collaborated with art/design and worked with the founder of Frosty Pop to realize his vision of a classic arcade game.

    Along with Big Time Sports, Frosty Pop has released 4 other Apple Arcade games: Don't Bug Me, The Pinball Wizard, Kings of the Castle, and The Get Out Kids.
    
    Apple Arcade games take full advantage of Apple's platform to create a unified experience across all of their devices (iOS, tvOS, and Mac). To this end, I built and integrated plugins to work with Apple APIs such as iCloud, Game Center leaderboards/achievements, and Game Center multiplayer. I also created a build system to automate the delivery of each game for iOS, tvOS and Mac.

    Marble Knights is a multiplayer RPG with... Marbles! It is also one of Way Forward's first games released on Apple Arcade.
    
    For Marble Knights, I built plugins to support Apple's Game Center multiplayer APIs, CloudKit for sync support, and MultipeerConnectivity for connecting local devices.

    The Morgan & Morgan app was built from the ground up to support the nation's largest personal injury firm. It features content related to the firm including news, past verdicts, attorneys, and more. The app also features important drug recalls that you can subscribe to in order to stay safe and informed.
    
    I worked closely with Morgan & Morgan to help bring their the app to life, creating the frontend, designing the backend API, and coordinating with a backend engineer to create the right solution that would help power the app.
