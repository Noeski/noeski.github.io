    Big Time Sports harkens back to the days of fast arcade action. With over 10 different mini-games to play there’s something for everyone. Big Time Sports is one of Apple Arcade’s exclusive launch titles available on iOS, tvOS, and Mac.
    
    I led the development of Big Time Sports, collaborated with art/design and worked with the founder of Frosty Pop to realize his vision of a classic arcade game.

    Along with Big Time Sports, Frosty Pop has released 3 other Apple Arcade games: Don't Bug Me, The Pinball Wizard, and The Get Out Kids.
    
    Apple Arcade games take full advantage of Apple's platform to create a unified experience across all of their devices (iOS, tvOS, and Mac). To this end, I built and integrated plugins to work with Apple APIs such as iCloud, GameCenter leaderboards/achievements, and GameCenter multiplayer. I also created a build system to automate the delivery of each game for iOS, tvOS and Mac.

    The Morgan & Morgan app was built from the ground up to support the nations largest personal injury firm. It features content related to the firm including news, past verdicts, attorneys, and more. The app also features important drug recalls that you can subscribe to in order to stay safe and informed.
    
    I worked closely with Morgan & Morgan to help bring their the app to life, creating the frontend, designing the backend API, and coordinating with a backend engineer to create the right solution that would help power the app.
